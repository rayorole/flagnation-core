# Welcome to Flagnation!
  
Flagnation: A decentralized market for buying unique flags on the **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org)** blokchain. There are a total of 10.000 flags and each one of them is unique.

## Who we are

Flagnation is proudly developed by [Olaf Mertens](https://www.instagram.com/olaf.mertens/) (UI designer) and [Ray OrolÃ©](https://www.instagram.com/ray.orole/) (Blockchain engineer).
We are both 16 years old and are truly inspired by the blockchain technology. So that's why we decided to program Flagnation
